## Vectors

Vectors aren't a location in space, they are the path taken from one point to another. A location can be a vector though because it is the path taken from the origin (0,0) to a certain point.

Think about it like telling someone directions, "Walk 10 steps up, then 4 to the right" (4, 10)
